Hello Everyone! This will be my first actual project with TOP. 
Throughout this course I learned a lot from using Git and Github to basic HTML. 
Asside from that I leared how to access folders and create files, repository, and even manage them through a terminal. 

Now, I will be demonstrating my skills with HTML by creating this project.
